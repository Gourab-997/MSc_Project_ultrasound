# Programs for my Msc project "Focusing of Ultrasound for Photoacoustic Subsurface Imaging via Atomic Force Microscopy"

The programs used for my Msc project in this repository comprise of <br/>
  a. Model Matlab-Livelink Code for generating parametric studies in COMSOL  
  b. Visualisation codes for measured acoustic echoes:  
    i . Filtering echo data from measuered data  
    ii. Fitting Oscillations near thermal peak for interface stiffness in AFM cantilever   
    iii. Comparing echo amplitudes near cantilever tip  
    
  c. Analysing Acoustic data:  
    i. Fitting echo data on cantilever body with RBF   
    ii. Estimating Echo amplitudes on the cantilever body
    
      
  d. Other codes to be updated
